## Dataset
- 5,000 customer records
- Features include age, income, education, credit card usage, mortgage, and account details
- Target variable: Personal Loan (Yes/No)

## Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning (handling negative experience values)
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Feature scaling and model evaluation

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Findings
- Income, credit card spending, and CD account ownership strongly predict loan acceptance
- Logistic Regression with feature scaling performed best
